# MCSR-Performance
A comprehensive guide (software and hardware) to get absolute maximum performance out of your PC for Minecraft Speedrunning (2025 rev 1.0)

# Summary


# Best Price-Performance PC Config

When you want the best performance out of your money usually we look at two CPU platforms, Ryzen 5000 and Intel 12th gen. This is because the motherboards and CPUs are really cheap and Intel 13th and 14th gen have some hard stability concerns. We are targeting both a 1000USD budget and a 600USD budget. 

We have no fear of recommending second-hand parts using platforms like ebay or jawa or even AliExpress, if you do not live in the United States adjust your platform of choice (For LATAM you can use Mercadolibre and for Spain, Wallapop). If you are not sure about this kind of buy I will also list new parts, albeit, with worse price-performance ratio.


When talking about Minecraft Speedrunning hardware configuration we are looking at a few important details on how to configure the build (and some are Linux-specific).
 - Powerful Gen4 m.2 SSD +3500MB/s recommended
 - Powerful CPU 6 core minimum, 8 recommended
 - GPU VRAM and performance does **not** matter
 - AMD GPU on Linux is recommended
 - Peripherals **DO** matter do not skimp on them!
 - Motherboard usually does not matter. We will not recommend very bad motherboards because of the VRM's (Power delivery to the CPU). That can cause catastrophic damage with a high-end CPU
 - RAM is extremely important for performance on high-core count CPU's. If you have a little money to spare you can buy a better RAM kit
