# MCSR-Performance
A comprehensive guide (software and hardware) to get absolute maximum performance out of your PC for Minecraft Speedrunning (2025 rev 1.0)

# Summary


# Best Price-Performance PC Config

When you want the best performance out of your money usually we look at two CPU platforms, Ryzen 5000 and Intel 12th gen. This is because the motherboards and CPUs are really cheap and Intel 13th and 14th gen have some hard stability concerns. We are targeting both a 1000USD budget and a 600USD budget, in the budget we do not include any peripherals.

We have no fear of recommending second-hand parts using platforms like ebay or jawa or even AliExpress, if you do not live in the United States adjust your platform of choice (For LATAM you can use Mercadolibre and for Spain, Wallapop). Do be wary of sketchy sellers, (Really new accounts, no ratings, bad ratings, too good of a deal...).

When talking about Minecraft Speedrunning hardware configuration we are looking at a few important details on how to configure the build (and some are Linux-specific):
 - Powerful Gen4 m.2 SSD +3500MB/s recommended.
 - Powerful CPU 6 core minimum, 8 recommended. This is the core of the build and will determine the overall performance on resetting.
 - GPU VRAM and performance does **not** matter. We only care about video encoding for streaming.
 - AMD GPU on Linux is recommended if you do not care about good encoding support for streaming and a [bad F3 pie chart](https://youtu.be/cbaUJWzXh18?si=Skky-MPVjeDGD_01). AMD did promise to address encoder problems on RX 9000 series gpus. I'll keep this updated but I would not bet on it.
 - Peripherals **DO** matter do not skimp on them! (High-end is way too much for MCSR, but do not buy a very cheap mouse+keyboard kit, membrane-keyboard, etc).
 - Motherboard usually does not matter. We will not recommend very bad motherboards (H-xxx for intel and A-xxx for AMD) because of the VRM's (Power delivery to the CPU). That can cause catastrophic damage with a high-end CPU.
 - RAM is extremely important for performance on high-core count CPU's. This is even more important while using a chiplet design CPU (like all ryzen 9 CPU's and Intel core Ultra line) If you have a little money to spare you can buy a better RAM kit and it will improve performance a few percentage points.
 - AMD Ryzen line CPU's preffer lower latency over higher RAM speed. While Intel prefers higher RAM speed over lower latency (except core Ultra's). (Latency DOES NOT MEAN CL Rating. Latency is calculated via this formula: CL x 2000/RamSpeed (MHz or MT's) (more on that on [Overclocking](#Overclock).

## 600USDS
### AMD Config:

CPU:
- AMD Ryzen 5 5500.
- AMD Ryzen 7 5700x/5800x (or non-x).
- AMD Ryzen 9 5900x (or non-x).
- AMD Ryzen 9 5950x (If you actually manage to get in budget...).

Depends on your budget. Ryzen 9 is preferred, Ryzen 7 if you can is recommended.

Motherboard: 
- MSI B550M PRO-VDH WiFi (budget, do not pair with ryzen 9). 
- MSI B550 Gaming Plus.
- MSI B550-A PRO.

Any motherboard that does well on [Hardware Unboxed Testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxczZChFaZI) (<80C on Ryzen 9 3950x OC) is recommended.

Disk:
- Teamgroup MP44 1TB/2TB 7400MB/s (High-end)
- WD Blue SN580 1TB/2TB 4150MB/s (Mid-end).
- WD Blue SN570 1TB/2TB 3500MB/s (Low-end).
- Kingston NV3 1TB/2TB 6000MB/s (High-end).
- Crucial P3 Plus 1TB/2TB 5000MB/s (Mid-end).
- Crucial P3 1TB/2TB 3500MB/s (Low-end).
- Sabrent Rocket 1TB/2TB (Extreme budget).
- WD Green SN350 1TB/2TB (Extreme budget).

While SSD Speed doesn't benefit the performance, it puts a hard-ceiling on it. I recommend a minimum of 3500mb/s. On Ryzen 9 Try to get a Mid-end SSD.

Faxiang and Adata drives are NOT recommended (Quality control issues). As well as samsung 980/990 lineup (You need to update the firmware on these drives).

RAM: 

Any kit will suffice. 16GB DDR4 (2x8GB) absolute minimum only go if you have a really low budget. 32GB DDR4 (2x16GB 3200MHz CL16 DDR4) recommended. Here is a few kits:

- Crucial Pro 3200MHz CL22 2x16gb CP2K16G4DFRA32A (Low-end).
- Corsair Vengeance LPX 3200MHz CL16 2x16 CMK32GX4M2E3200C16 (Mid-end).
- TeamGroup T-FORCE VULCAN Z 3200MHz CL16 2x8 TLZGD416G3200H (Low-end) (Warning: only 16GB).
- G.Skill Ripjaws V DDR4-3200 CL16 2x16 F4-3200C16D-32G (Mid-end).
- TeamGroup T-FORCE Delta RGB DDR4-3200 CL16 2x16 TF4D432G3200HC1 (Mid-end).
- G.Skill Trident Z RGB DDR4-3200 CL16 2x16 F4-3200C16D-32GTZR (Mid-end).
- G.Skill Trident Z Neo Series RGB DDR4-3600 CL16 2x16 F4-3600C16D-32GTZNC (High-end).

Adata kits are not recommended because of their low reliability, that also goes for any offbrand aliexpress kit.

GPU: 
- Nvidia GTX 1650.
- Nvidia GTX 1650 Super.
- Nvidia GTX 1660.
- Nvidia GTX 1660 Super.
- AMD Radeon RX 5600XT.
- Nvidia RTX 2060.
- AMD Radeon RX 5700XT.
- Intel Arc B580.
- Nvidia RTX 3060 12GB.
- AMD Radeon RX 6600XT.
- Nvidia RTX 3060Ti.
- AMD Radeon RX 6700XT.

AMD GPU's have extremely weak encoding support and a [bad F3 pie chart](https://youtu.be/cbaUJWzXh18?si=Skky-MPVjeDGD_01) that make them hard to recommend. Only buy them if you don't mind low-streaming quality and the bad F3 pie chart.

Depends on budget, cards ordered by rasterization performance (Where last is the best) based on [Techpowerup relative performance chart](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/geforce-rtx-4090.c3889) and [Hardware Unboxed B580 Overhead Testing](https://youtu.be/00GmwHIJuJY?si=LPrTZA8G5Suzo9vH), if you also want to game on your machine go for higher tiers.

PSU: 
- Tier A: Adata XPG Core Reactor (I and II), MSI MPG-A GF, Corsair RM 2019-2021 series.
- Tier B: Cooler Master MWE Gold V2, Corsair CX-F RGB.
- Tier C: ADATA XPG Pylon, MSI MAG A-BN, Corsair CX-M 2021 â€“ CV 650/750W.

Depends on budget, ordered by Tier on the [PSU tier-list](https://cultists.network/140/psu-tier-list/). Do NOT use a power supply of tier D or lower. This list is outdated and a revision would be appreciated, open a PR for new source suggestions.

Case: 
- Phanteks XT Pro Ultra (and XT Pro).
- Lian Li Lancool 207.
- Corsair 4000D Airflow.
- Phanteks P400A.
- Phanteks G400A.

Get the cheaper one at the time (Or the one that you like the most).

Thermal Paste: 
- Thermalright TF9.
- Artic Mx-(any).
- Honeywell PTM7950 (only for high-end builds, difficult to find online as of now)

Cooler: Stock Cooler (Ryzen 5) Thermalright Peerless Assassin 120 (Ryzen 7 or 9). If you want a liquid cooler for overclock I would go no higher than a Thermalright Frozen Prism 360mm due to the budget constraints.

Feel free to open PR about new parts and issues about problematic old ones!

### Intel Config:

CPU:
- Intel i5 12600k.
- Intel i7 12700k.
- Intel i9 12900k.
- Intel i7 13700k/14700k.

  K suffix refers to overclockable chips
  KF suffix refers to overclockable chips without graphics
  F suffix refers to chips that are not overclockable and don't have graphics. These chips are usually slightly cheaper but are slightly slower than their K/KF counterparts
  no suffix refers to chips that are not overclockable but closer to performance than the F suffix chip

  All of these chips are good for the purposes of mcsr. Stores like Microcenter offer higher tier 12900k chips for 140 usd, 12700k chips for 108 usd,and more. These are through microcenter part bundles that include motherboard and ram.

## 1000USDS (or more)
### AMD Config:

- AMD Ryzen 7 9700x.
- AMD Ryzen 9 9900x.
- AMD Ryzen 9 9950x (If you somehow fit it into budget).

Depends on your budget. Ryzen 9 is preferred, Ryzen 7 if you can is recommended.

Motherboard: 

**Be wary that 600 series motherboards only support ryzen 9000 with a BIOS update. If you buy one for a ryzen 9000 be sure your motherboard supports BIOS flashback.**

If you want to overclock use a X670(E) for ryzen 7000 (except Asrock B650M-HDV/m.2) or 870(E) for 9000.

Use a case that can sustain the CPU that you used in the build, for that you can check reviews of the cases online. The low-ends will only cool up to a 9900x or 7950x.

Thermal Paste: 
- Thermalright TF9. (High-end)
- Honeywell PTM7950 (Best performance, difficult to find online as of now. Use it if you can).

Cooler: Thermalright Frozen Prism 360mm or Artic Liquid Freezer III 360mm/420mm.

### Intel Config:

## Microcenter Combos and Deals

Microcenter (US Only) usually has some really good value combos and deals on their website and in person locations. If you are low on budget or you want the maximum penny try to get one of these:

[Microcenter AMD Bundles](https://www.microcenter.com/site/content/bundle-and-save.aspx)

[Microcenter Intel Bundles](https://www.microcenter.com/site/content/intel-bundle-and-save.aspx)

Then you can continue the build process just ignoring the things you already bought in the bundle.
