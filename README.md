# MCSR-Performance
A comprehensive guide (software and hardware) to get absolute maximum performance out of your PC for Minecraft Speedrunning (2025 rev 1.0)

# Summary


# Best Price-Performance PC Config

When you want the best performance out of your money usually we look at two CPU platforms, Ryzen 5000 and Intel 12th gen. This is because the motherboards and CPUs are really cheap and Intel 13th and 14th gen have some hard stability concerns. We are targeting both a 1000USD budget and a 600USD budget, in the budget we do not include any peripherals.

We have no fear of recommending second-hand parts using platforms like ebay or jawa or even AliExpress, if you do not live in the United States adjust your platform of choice (For LATAM you can use Mercadolibre and for Spain, Wallapop).

On AMD CPU's RAM latency is more important than speed (more on that on [Overclocking](#Overclock).

When talking about Minecraft Speedrunning hardware configuration we are looking at a few important details on how to configure the build (and some are Linux-specific):
 - Powerful Gen4 m.2 SSD +3500MB/s recommended.
 - Powerful CPU 6 core minimum, 8 recommended. This is the core of the build and will determine the overall performance on resetting.
 - GPU VRAM and performance does **not** matter.
 - AMD GPU on Linux is recommended.
 - Peripherals **DO** matter do not skimp on them! (High-end is way too much for MCSR, but do not buy a very cheap mouse+keyboard kit, membrane-keyboard, etc).
 - Motherboard usually does not matter. We will not recommend very bad motherboards (H-xxx for intel and A-xxx for AMD) because of the VRM's (Power delivery to the CPU). That can cause catastrophic damage with a high-end CPU.
 - RAM is extremely important for performance on high-core count CPU's. If you have a little money to spare you can buy a better RAM kit.

### AMD Config:

CPU:
- AMD Ryzen 5 5500.
- AMD Ryzen 7 5700x/5800x (or non-x).
- AMD Ryzen 9 5900x (or non-x).
- AMD Ryzen 9 5950x (If you actually manage to get in budget...).

Depends on your budget. Ryzen 9 is preferred, Ryzen 7 if you can is recommended.

Motherboard: 
- MSI B550M PRO-VDH WiFi (budget, do not pair with ryzen 9). 
- MSI B550 Gaming Plus.
- MSI B550-A PRO.

Any motherboard that does well on [Hardware Unboxed Testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxczZChFaZI) (<80C on Ryzen 9 3950x OC) is recommended.

Disk:
- WD Blue SN580 1TB/2TB 4150MB/s (Mid-end).
- WD Blue SN570 1TB/2TB 3500MB/s (Low-end).
- Kingston NV3 1TB/2TB 6000MB/s (Mid-end).
- Crucial P3 Plus 1TB/2TB 5000MB/s (Mid-end).
- Crucial P3 1TB/2TB 3500MB/s (Low-end).
- Sabrent Rocket 1TB/2TB (Extreme budget).
- WD Green SN350 1TB/2TB (Extreme budget).

While SSD Speed doesn't benefit the performance, it puts a hard-ceiling on it. I recommend a minimum of 3500mb/s. On Ryzen 9 Try to get a Mid-end SSD.

Faxiang and Adata drives are NOT recommended (Quality control issues). As well as samsung 980/990 lineup (You need to update the firmware on these drives).

RAM: 

Any kit will suffice. 16GB (2x8GB) absolute minimum. 32GB (2x16GB 3200MHz CL16 DDR4) recommended.

GPU: 
- Nvidia GTX 1650.
- Nvidia GTX 1650 Super.
- Nvidia GTX 1660.
- Nvidia GTX 1660 Super.
- AMD Radeon RX 5600XT.
- Nvidia RTX 2060.
- AMD Radeon RX 5700XT.
- Intel Arc B580.
- Nvidia RTX 3060 12GB.
- AMD Radeon RX 6600XT.
- Nvidia RTX 3060Ti.
- AMD Radeon RX 6700XT.

AMD GPU's have extremely weak encoding support and a [bad F3 pie chart](https://youtu.be/cbaUJWzXh18?si=Skky-MPVjeDGD_01) that make them hard to recommend. Only buy them if you don't mind low-streaming quality and the bad F3 pie chart.

Depends on budget, cards ordered by rasterization performance (Where last is the best) based on [Techpowerup relative performance chart](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/geforce-rtx-4090.c3889) and [Hardware Unboxed B580 Overhead Testing](https://youtu.be/00GmwHIJuJY?si=LPrTZA8G5Suzo9vH), if you also want to game on your machine go for higher tiers.

PSU: 
- Tier A: Adata XPG Core Reactor (I and II), MSI MPG-A GF, Corsair RM 2019-2021 series.
- Tier B: Cooler Master MWE Gold V2, Corsair CX-F RGB.
- Tier C: ADATA XPG Pylon, MSI MAG A-BN, Corsair CX-M 2021 â€“ CV 650/750W.

Depends on budget, ordered by Tier on the [PSU tier-list](https://cultists.network/140/psu-tier-list/). Do NOT use a power supply of tier D or lower.

Case: 
- Phanteks XT Pro Ultra (and XT Pro).
- Lian Li Lancool 207.
- Corsair 4000D Airflow.
- Phanteks P400A.

Get the cheaper one at the time (Or the one that you like the most).

Thermal Paste: 
- Thermalright TF9.
- Artic Mx-(any).

Cooler: Stock Cooler (Ryzen 5) Thermalright Peerless Assassin 120 (Ryzen 7 or 9)
